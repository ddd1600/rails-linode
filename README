This is a stackscript for use on Linode to setup a Ruby on Rails environment. I pieced it together from a few resources mentioned below. It is intended for use on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), but may likely work on other deb systems.

It installs:

- MySQL
- Postfix
- Ruby 1.9.3 p125
- Nginx
- Passenger
- Rails
- node.js

It also sets up a couple handy things like:

- Script to control Nginx ($> service nginx start|stop|restart)
- A deployment user for use with Capistrano

A few notes:

Once the script completes you'll find Nginx installed in /usr/local. You'll likely need to edit Nginx's conf to be appropriate for your setup.

Future possibilities, maybe?:

- rbenv
- apt-get install Nginx vs Passenger Nginx
